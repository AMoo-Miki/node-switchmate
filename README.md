#node-switchmate


A Node.js API for [Switchmate](http://www.myswitchmate.com).  Switchmate is a Bluetooth LE lightswitch cover which allows for the automation of lightswitches without needing to rewire your home.

This API was developed using the "Rocker" models of the Switchmate (RSM0001 & RSM0002), though the Toggle models (TSM0001 & TSM0002)  will ***hopefully*** work too.   

This API is experimental and may need further refinement.  Anyone knowledgeable who is willing to help is welcome!
